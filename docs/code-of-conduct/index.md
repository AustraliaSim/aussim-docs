    Follow the Golden Rule  
    For life's a two way street  
    Keep that in mind and you'll be kind  
    To everyone you meet  

    Follow the Golden Rule  
    It isn't hard to do  
    Always treat others like sisters and brothers  
    And they'll do the same for you  

    Before you harm your fellow man  
    Ask this question first:  
    How would you wish that he treat you  
    If your fortunes were reversed?  

    Follow the Golden Rule  
    That's how I choose to live  
    Wow, simple reciprocity is always my philosophy  
    I get back what I give  

    Team StarKid, Twisted, ‘The Golden Rule’

AustraliaSim has rules known as the "Code of Conduct" that all members must follow.

> “I hope you have a fun time chatting with people, talking about politics, and of course, debating Bills
> before the Parliament.”  
> /u/General_Rommel

AustraliaSim is a place where people from all across the political spectrum meet and have productive
discussions about all sorts of topics.

We want to encourage discussion, and we recognise that disagreement is a natural part of working with other
people, but sometimes what may have started as good faith discussion turns unsavoury, and leaves everyone
involved worse for it.

In order to keep the quality of our discussions high and to look after the interests of our community, we have
created this Code of Conduct to clearly outline what kinds of behaviour are, and are not, acceptable in
AustraliaSim.
