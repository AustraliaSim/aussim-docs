# Penalites

## Warning
A warning is the lowest form of punishment.
It should be logged against users but not taken further.

## Mute
A user who is muted loses the ability to engage in discussion on the Discord server for a set period.   
Engaging in the Discord outside of the section for banned users counts as contravention.   
Users may be muted from specific channels rather than the whole server if appropriate.

## Ban
A user who is banned may not be in any affiliated Discord servers or engage in the subreddits. 
Party representatives are expected to remove banned users from their party servers.
