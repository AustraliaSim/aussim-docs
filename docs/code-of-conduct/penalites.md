# Penalites

## Warning
A warning is the lowest form of punishment.
It should be logged against users but not taken further.

## Mute
A user who is muted loses their right to engage in discussion on the main discord server for a set period. 
Engaging in the discord outside of the section for banned users counts as contravention
Users may be muted from specific channels rather than the whole server if appropriate.
#### Interim Mute
A special form of mute used when a user is awaiting a further punishment or investigations are ongoing

## Ban
A user who is banned may not be in any affiliated discord servers or engage in the subreddits. 
Party representatives are expected to remove banned users from their party servers.
Failure to do so may result in punishment if found necessary by the Moderators
