## Fostering hateful opinions
Do not attempt to spread or encourage opinions which are hateful or toxic or otherwise not appropriate in modern discourse.
This includes but is not limited to bigotry, racism, transphobia, and ableism.  
This will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.  
Genuine belief is not a defence. You can genuinely believe something that isn't widely agreed with, without violating this rule through abusive language.

!!! note "Example"
    This rule seeks to directly address abusive speech that falls under the banner of hate speech, including racism.

    For example, someone may disagree with the actions of a First Nations person when it comes to First Nations issues. Calling them a "race traitor", or calling into question their heritage, would be racism and therefore not allowed.
