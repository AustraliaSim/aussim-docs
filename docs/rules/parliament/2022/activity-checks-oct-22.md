# Activity Checks

I as the Parliament Moderator of AustraliaSim enact the following Meta Rule under section 10(4) of the Meta Constitution:

The Standing Orders are amended by repealing the section relating with Participation Requirements and replacing it with the following:

## Participation & Ejection

### Participation Overview

All MPs and Senators are expected to make active contributions to the simulation. If the Parliament Moderator in agreement with the Speakership, with evidence, feels that an MP or Senator is not meeting such an expectation, they may be ejected from the House of Representatives.

### Examples of Contributions to the Simulator

Methods that MPs and Senators can contribute is by:

1. legislating bills, motions and MPIs;

2. debating on bills, motions or MPIs;

3. asking and answering questions on questions with or without notice;

4. voting on legislation; and

5. proposing amendments to legislation.

### Reviewing Contributions of MPs and Senators

The Parliament Moderator and the Speakership shall undertake, every two weeks, an internal review of contributions by MPs and Senators.

If there is agreement that an MP or Senator has displayed insufficient contribution to the simulator, and there is insufficient reason for this lack of contribution offered by the MP or Senator in question, the Parliament Moderator must eject the MP or Senator from their respective chamber.

When there is a decision to eject an MP or Senator, the Parliament Moderator must provide the evidence that led to the decision to eject for the scrutiny of AustraliaSim.

Note: Ejections shall be treated as being ineligible under section 20 of the Constitution in the case of a Senator, and under section 38 of the Constitution in the case of an MP.

The aim is to make the dynamics of player ejection similar to moderation, with more stringent requirements. Activity Checks in the past and present have been inefficient at ejecting members that need to be ejected, hence opening the system to a bit more flexibility.

The Meta Rule will be enacted on the 8th of October, 2022.
