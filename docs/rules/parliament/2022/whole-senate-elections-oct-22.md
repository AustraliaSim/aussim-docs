# Whole Senate Elections


I, NGSpy, as Parliament Moderator, under section 10(4) of the Meta Constitution, enact the following Meta Rule:

The Canon Constitution shall be amended as follows:

(1) In section 7 (The Senate), omit "six months", substitute "three months".

(2) Repeal sections 13 (Rotation of senators) and 14 (Further provision for rotation).

Note: This amendment will take effect at the next general election 26th General ^Election.

This amendment will cause the end of the half-Senate election model, as it has proven to be inefficient for the purposes of continuous engagement with the simulator. From the 26th General Election, the entire senate shall be elected all at once.

The Meta Rule will be enacted on the 8th of October, 2022.
