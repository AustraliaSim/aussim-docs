# The Meta Constitution of AustraliaSim

## Options to vote on
**1. Game Admin 18+ or 16+**  
[View here](/constitution/#appointment)  
If 16+ is voted for, it passing is dependent on 2. passing as well.

**2. Game Admin is inherently a Moderator or not**
[View here](/constitution/#powers-and-de-facto-appointements)  
If this is voted for, the Game Admin is not required to be an active Discord/Subreddit Moderator so they can focus on running the canon.

**3. Change VoCs to be less regular**  
[View here - admins/mod team](/constitution/#powers-and-de-facto-appointements)    
[View here - Discord Moderators/Community Managers](/constitution/#moderators)    
[View here - Clerks](/constitution/#clerks)  
[View here - EC](/constitution/#electoral-commission)  
[View here - Events](/constitution/#events-team)
Reason - 6 months is excessive and ends up being procedure. 12 months allows more time for the quality of that person in their role to be reflected, and encourages use of VONCs if there is an issue otherwise. If this is voted against, Clerk/EC/Events will still be changed to 12 months but Admins/Mods will remin at 6.
